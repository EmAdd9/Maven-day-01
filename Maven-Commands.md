# Maven Command Examples:

Here are some common Maven commands that you can use in your project:

- `mvn compile`: Compiles the project's source code.

- `mvn test`: Runs unit tests against the compiled code.

- `mvn package`: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format.

- `mvn install`: Installs the package into the local repository for use as a dependency in other projects.

- `mvn deploy`: Deploys the package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers or environments.

- `mvn site`: Generates project documentation and reports.

- `mvn site-deploy`: Deploys the generated documentation to a remote web server for public access.

- `mvn clean`: Executes the clean phase, deleting any previous build outputs.

These commands streamline the build and development process and ensure consistency and reliability across different environments. For more information on using Maven and its commands, refer to the official Maven documentation: [Maven Documentation](https://maven.apache.org/documentation.html)
