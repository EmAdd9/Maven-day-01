# Maven Build Lifecycle

Maven provides three built-in build lifecycles: clean, default, and site, each with its associated build phases.

### Clean Lifecycle

The clean lifecycle is responsible for deleting any build output generated by previous builds. The primary phase in this lifecycle is:

- `clean`: Deletes any build output and temporary files generated by previous builds.

### Default Lifecycle

The default lifecycle is the most important one and is automatically executed when running `mvn` without any specific lifecycle or phase. It comprises the following build phases:

- `validate`: Validates the project structure and verifies if all necessary information is available.
- `compile`: Compiles the project's source code.
- `test`: Runs unit tests against the compiled source code.
- `package`: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format, such as JAR or WAR.
- `install`: Installs the package into the local repository (`.m2`) for use as a dependency in other projects.
- `deploy`: Deploys the package to a remote repository, such as Nexus, for sharing with other developers or environments.

### Site Lifecycle

The site lifecycle is focused on generating project documentation and reports. It includes the following build phases:

- `site`: Generates project documentation and reports.
- `site-deploy`: Deploys the generated documentation to a remote web server for public access.

When you run a specific build phase, Maven automatically executes all preceding phases in the corresponding lifecycle. This ensures a structured and consistent build process, simplifying the development workflow and enhancing project maintainability.
