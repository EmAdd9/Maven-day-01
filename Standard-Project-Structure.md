## Standard Project Structure:

```
my-app
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    |-- main
    |   `-- java
    |       `-- com
    |           `-- mycompany
    |               `-- app
    |                   `-- App.java
    `-- test
        `-- java
            `-- com
                `-- mycompany
                    `-- app
                        `-- AppTest.java
```

The above directory structure represents a standard Maven project layout for "my-app." Here's a brief explanation of each component:

- `pom.xml`: The core configuration file for the Maven project, as discussed earlier.

- `src`: The source directory contains the main application code and test code.

  - `main`: The main application code resides in this directory.

    - `java`: The Java source code files for the application are placed here. The package structure typically follows the reverse domain name convention. In this example, the package is `com.mycompany.app`, and the main Java file is `App.java`.

  - `test`: The test code resides in this directory.

    - `java`: The Java source code files for the test cases are placed here. The package structure mirrors the main source code. In this example, the test case Java file is `AppTest.java`.

This standardized project structure ensures clarity and consistency in Maven projects, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the project layout. It also facilitates smooth integration with build tools and continuous integration systems.
